# 👋 Hi, I’m Otito 

💻 **Software Engineer & AI Automation Specialist**

## 👨‍💻 What I Do  
I solve real-world problems by building backend systems that are scalable, resilient, and smart. If your product is slow, your infrastructure fragile, or your workflows manual, I build solutions that fix that—fast.

## 🚀 Projects & Experience

| Project | Description | Technologies | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Triage AI** | AI-powered clinical triage assistant that helps route cases & assess symptoms | Streamlit, Mistral API, Python | Reduced time to initial triage by ~60% in pilot runs |
| **Automation Workflows** | Scraping, summarization, notification & task automation for SMB & health-tech use cases | Python, Make, APIs | Saved 10+ hours/week of manual work for clients |
| **Health Data Pipelines** | LIS/EHR integrations, dashboards for clinical analytics & reporting | Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Pandas | Processed thousands of records/week; improved report correctness by 90% |
| **Cloud & Container Infrastructure** | Docker-ized APIs deployed and maintained on AWS (EC2 / ECS / ECR) with CI/CD pipelines | Docker, AWS EC2 / ECS, AWS ECR, IAM, Monitoring (CloudWatch) | Deployed backend systems handling 5,000+ daily users, achieving ~99.9% uptime; cut deployment cycle time by ~80% |
